# Electrate

This template is my personal variation of [Electrate](https://github.com/mmick66/electrate).

## Installing

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/fhormot/electrate-edited-template my-app
# Go into the repository
cd my-app
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running

```
npm run start
```

## Testing

The tool of choice is [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react.html) as used at Facebook. Create files with the extension `*.test.js` and they will be run through

```
npm run test
```

## Packaging

Replace the icon inside the `build` folder and run

```bash
npm run release
```

Check the `dist` folder for the app
